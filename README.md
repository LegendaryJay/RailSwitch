# RailSwitch

## How to use

### Setup

1. Place a sign in the block above a detector rail. **It must be reinforced on the same group as the detector rail.**
2. The first line must be `[destination]` (case insensitive)
3. The second, third and fourth lines can be destination names.
4. When a player passes over the detector rail, it will only activate and emit redstone if a player set their destination as any of the three on the sign.

You may also use `[!destination]`, which will activate the rail if a player's destination is **not** on the signs.

### Usage

1. Create a sign with '[destination]' on the first line and your destination on the second line.
2. Place a button above or below the sign.
3. Press the button to select that destination.
